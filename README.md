 In this repo , I'm trying to share with you my journey of learning react
 At the end of this challenge I should be able to use React concepts to build multiple projects that I can push into this repo too
 Btw I used Dev Ed's course, It's available on his youtube channel so you can check it : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGcsHMXbSOA&list=PLDyQo7g0_nsVHmyZZpVJyFn5ojlboVEhE&index=1
